# Note to self (and to anyone forks it)
# Some sites create robots.txt and sitemap(.xml(.gz)) files on the fly
# If you are sure that they are indeed static, uncomment the following location blocks for each and adject the expires headers to fit your site's needs
# location = /robots.txt { expires 1d; log_not_found off; access_log off; }
# location ~ \.xml(\.gz)?$ { expires 600s; log_not_found off; access_log off; }
